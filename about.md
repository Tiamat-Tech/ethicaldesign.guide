Tech is all around us, developing fast, and not going away. Which is why ethics should be a part of the design and engineering curriculum, and a focus for anyone working in the tech industry.

Without it, we risk creating products that cause harm, often against already minoritised people. Think of the predictive policing software that’s biased against Black people, products that reinforcing gender stereotypes and excluding non-binary folks, or all the websites that are not accessible to disabled people, to name a few examples.

That’s why I created this directory, Ethical Design Guide, with resources meant to educate those in tech about the issues our industry faces, along with tools and possible solutions. More resources will be added continuously, and updates can be subscribed to through RSS or the newsletter.

This originally started as a Notion document in June 2020, however, I decided to move it over to a self-hosted platform for several reasons. Doing it this way allows others to submit resources, in a supervised way without allowing trolls to misuse the functionality, by creating a pull request on GitHub.

There is also the issue of Notion's questionable responses to the Black Lives Matter movement, making them no longer viable as a platform to host a list of ethical design resources on. 

If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, you can open an issue for them on GitHub, I use the following labels:
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility bugs and improvements
- **Bug**: A general bug, something doesn’t seem to be working
- **Feature**: Requests and suggestions for new features
- **Improvement**: General design and code improvements

It’s only me (@liatrisbian) behind this project, so more functionality will be added gradually, and accessibility bugs and improvements will be prioritized. The following features are already on the roadmap:
- **Improved list design** will add categories and a description to each resource.
- **Improved filter functionality** will allow to filter both by type and categories. 
- **Dark mode**, possibly along with other themes. 

If you see a resource that shouldn’t be here or want to add one of your own, please create a pull request with the fix instead. More information about this is in the submission guidelines.
