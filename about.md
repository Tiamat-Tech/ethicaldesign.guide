# About the Ethical Design Guide

Tech is all around us, developing fast, and not going away. Which is why ethics should be a part of the design and engineering curriculum, and a focus for everyone working in the tech and design industry.

Without it, we risk creating products that cause harm, often against already minoritised people. Think of the predictive policing software that’s biased against Black people, products that reinforcing gender stereotypes and excluding non-binary folks, or all the websites that are not accessible to disabled people, to name a few examples.

Tech is always political. The way data is collected and handled is often biased, and many products are neither accessible nor inclusive. Ethical Design Guide is made to share resources on how to create ethical products that don't cause harm. More links will be added continuously. Subscribe to the [mailing list]() to receive a bi-weekly update on new resources and interesting new reads.

## Bugs, improvements, and feature requests

If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, you can open an issue for them on GitHub, and use one of the following labels:

- **Accessibility**: Accessibility bugs and improvements
- **Bug**: A general bug, something doesn’t seem to be working
- **Feature**: Requests and suggestions for new features
- **Improvement**: General design and code improvements

There's only one person working on this project, so more functionality will be added gradually, and accessibility bugs and improvements will be prioritized. The following features are already on the roadmap:

- Improved list design
- Improved filters and recommendations
- Dark mode

Future additions may also include our own blog posts, guides and checklists.

If you see a resource that shouldn’t be here or want to add one of your own, please create a pull request with the change instead. More information about this can be found in the [submission guidelines](/submit).

## About the creator

[Sarah Fossheim](https://fossheim.io/) ([@liatrisbian](https://twitter.com/liatrisbian)) is a multidisciplinary developer and designer focused on creating inclusive and accessible products. They have worked with design agencies, big coroporations, and startups within cancer medicine and education.

They created Ethical Design Guide in August 2020, with the goal of making it easier and more accessible to create inclusive products. 

It originally started with a Notion document in June 2020, but was moved over to its own self-hosted platform for several reasons. Doing it this way allows others to submit resources in a supervised way without allowing trolls to misuse the functionality, by creating a pull request on GitHub. 

There is also the issue of Notion's [questionable responses]() to the Black Lives Matter movement, making them no longer viable as a platform for hosting a list of ethical design resources.
