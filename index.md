Ethical Design Guide is a directory of resources to guide designers, engineers, project managers, copywriters, and others in tech in creating more ethical, fair and inclusive services and products. Tech is political and can seriously harm people from minoritized groups. Our product should not cause harm. The directory will be continiously updated.
